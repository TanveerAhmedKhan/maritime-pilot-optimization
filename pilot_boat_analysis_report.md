## Safety and Operational Recommendations

### 1. Resource Optimization
- **High-performing pilot boats** (373493000, 440018500, 440051510) should be prioritized for complex operations
- Consider increasing utilization of underused pilot boats to distribute workload
- **Peak hour staffing** should be enhanced for 14:00 and midnight operations

### 2. Vessel-Specific Protocols
- **MMSI 354307000** requires enhanced assistance protocols due to extended session durations
- **MMSI 440013330** needs frequent but brief interventions - consider streamlined procedures
- Vessels achieving close proximity (< 50m) should have specialized safety protocols

### 3. Temporal Optimization
- **Afternoon peak** (14:00) requires maximum pilot boat availability
- **Night operations** (midnight) need adequate lighting and safety measures
- Consider scheduling non-urgent operations outside peak hours

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- Track minimum approach distances to ensure safety compliance
- Monitor session durations to identify vessels requiring special attention
- Implement real-time proximity alerts for distances under 100 meters
